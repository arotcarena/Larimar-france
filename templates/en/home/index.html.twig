                <p>
                        Creator of solid silver jewelry for men, women, and children, I have been a larimar specialist in France for over 24 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I fell in love with this confidential stone in 1985 during a fair in Sainte-Marie aux Mines (Vosges). After several trips around the world and to the Dominican Republic (the only known deposit of this blue pectolite), I started importing raw larimar in 1999.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I offer it in various shapes and sizes and I am well acquainted with its characteristics, qualities, and imperfections (yes, it has them if you don't take good care of it).
                </p>
                <p>
                        My love for this stone is immeasurable; I dedicate a part of my life to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                        It's an immense pride for me to see larimar on your fingers, around your necks, on your wrists, and your ears.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Have you noticed? My first name (Marie-Laure) is partly an anagram of Larimar. If that isn't a sign?
                </p>
                <p>
                        Thank you so much for loving this stone.
                </p>
